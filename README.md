# Pat's Online Minimart

***Pat's Online Minimart*** is a minimum viable product (MVP) of an online store that allows its online shoppers to browse various items sold by Uncle Pat and for Uncle Pat himself to manage his store items in an inventory style. 

## Usage

1. Clone this repository into any directory on your computer.
2. Launch a terminal and access the "pat-online-minimart" directory. 
3. Check that you have Python 3.10.12 and above installed by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`. Otherwise, you may install it via https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
4. Install the required Python modules by typing `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
5. Finally, launch the server by typing `python run.py` or `python3 run.py`. You should now see the application being served on http://127.0.0.1:5000. The admin account credentials are as follow: 
   - Username: `unclepat` 
   - Password: `unclepat_2023_08` 

## Assumptions and Interpretations

1. Uncle Pat's admin account(s) is/are pre-created in `run.py` for this MVP without a dedicated registration portal, just for testing purposes of the user and admin views of the online store. 
2. Uncle Pat only requires item name, item description, item price and quantity (i.e. stock) be listed in his online store for shoppers' browsing. He does not require a shopping cart to be implemented at this stage.

## Deployment on Cloud Environment

I am currently taking the AWS CLF-C01 Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and hence, I am more familiar with the Amazon Web Services (AWS). Given that my web application was developed in Python flask, I can leverage on AWS Lambda's serverless offering. 

With serverless deployment, we will not require a container for our application. AWS Lambda will scale and manage the computing resources while API gateway acts as a trigger for the Lambda function, allowing it to handle HTTP requests from the Internet. By integrating the AWS Lambda with API gateway, there will be a frontend to handle the HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate Lambda function. As AWS Lambda does not natively support the WSGI standard used by Python flask, we will need the AWSGI adapter that allows the Flask application to understand the event format from the API gateway and respond accordingly. Thereafter, our flask application code can be included in an AWS Lambda function.

In the AWS Management Console, we can configure API Gateway to define the REST API endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, etc.). Each endpoint will be linked to the appropriate AWS Lambda function that we created and we can make them publicly accessible for us to serve our Flask application in the cloud.

Below are two helpful articles which provide detailed instructions on how to deploy a flask application on AWS with different serverless components:

## Security Hardening Techniques on a Cloud Environment 

There are a variety of techniques to harden the security of the flask application, especially when deploying on a cloud environment like AWS which already comes with a set of features that we can tap on. 

First and foremost, we should ensure that our web application is served via HTTPS so that the data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. AWS provides the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) service that allows us to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates for our domain.

Secondly, we can utilize the AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect our application from common web exploits like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) and others. Within our Python flask code, we also implemented Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection as well as both server-side and client-side form input validation for our database fields. Moreover, SQLAlchemy uses parameterized queries, a.k.a. prepared statements, to execute our SQL queries safely. The combination of both WAF and best practices in our code forms the robust defense against common web security threats. 

Furthermore, we should place emphasis on proper Identity and Access Management (IAM) measures. For example, we should adopt the principle of least privilege and grant only necessary permissions to our web application as well as the supporting resources. Strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) should also be implemented. Aside, the application's performance and security should be constantly monitored with services such as the Amazon CloudWatch. To add on, it will also be good to have logging of CRUD-related operations built directly in our Python flask application so that we constantly maintain an audit trail of actions performed by users. 

In addition, a comprehensive security strategy should also include continuous security assessments, regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively. Regularly review and updating the web application and infrastructure configurations help us to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices and patches. Notably, we can also employ tools like AWS CloudFormation or AWS Elastic Beanstalk to ensure consistent and secure deployments of our application whenever we introduce new features.
