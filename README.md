# Pat's Online Minimart

***Pat's Online Minimart*** is a minimum viable product (MVP) of an online store that allows its online shoppers to browse various items sold by Uncle Pat and for Uncle Pat himself to manage his store items in an inventory style. 

## Usage

1. Clone this repository into any directory on your computer.
2. Launch a terminal and access the "pat-online-minimart" directory. 
3. Check that you have Python 3.10.12 and above installed by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`. Otherwise, you may install it via https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
4. Install the required Python modules by typing `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
5. Finally, launch the server by typing `python run.py` or `python3 run.py`. You should now see the application being served on http://127.0.0.1:5000. 

## Assumptions and Interpretations

1. Uncle Pat's admin account(s) is/are pre-created in `run.py` for this MVP without a dedicated registration portal, just for testing purposes of the user and admin views of the online store. 
2. Uncle Pat only requires item name, item description, item price and quantity (i.e. stock) be listed in his online store for shoppers' browsing. He does not require a shopping cart to be implemented at this stage.
